# Concrete_Compressive_Strength_Regression_Analysis
Project for an 'Applied Linear Models' course where concrete data was analyzed to observe which variables influence concrete compressive strength prediction more than others and what transformations are needed to linearly model the data. Includes data exploration/visualization, full and reduced model building, residual analysis, and in-depth model comparison. Included are the R notebook, project report, and data set.
